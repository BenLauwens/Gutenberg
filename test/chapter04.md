The first of the fundamental problems that are considered in calculus, is the problem of slopes, that is finding the slope of (the tangent line to) a given curve at a given point on the curve. The solution of the problem of slopes is the subject of differential calculus. As we will see, it has many applications in mathematics and other disciplines.

## Tangent Lines and their Slopes

This section deals with the problem of finding a straight line ``L`` that is tangent to a curve ``C`` at a point ``P``. As is often the case in mathematics, the most important step in the solution of such a fundamental problem is making a suitable definition.

For simplicity, and to avoid certain problems best postponed until later, we will not deal with the most general kinds of curves now, but only with those that are the graphs of continuous functions. Let ``C`` be the graph of ``y=f\left(x\right)`` and let ``P`` be the point ``\left(x_0,y_0\right)`` on ``C``, so that ``y_0=f\left(x_0\right)``. We assume that ``P`` is not an endpoint of ``C``. Therefore, ``C`` extends some distance on both sides of ``P``.

What do we mean when we say that the line ``L`` is tangent to ``C`` at ``P``?

A reasonable definition of tangency can be stated in terms of limits. If ``Q`` is a point on ``C`` different from ``P``, then the line through ``P`` and ``Q`` is called a secant line to the curve. This line rotates around ``P`` as ``Q`` moves along the curve. If ``L`` is a line through ``P`` whose slope is the limit of the slopes of these secant lines ``PQ`` as ``Q`` approaches ``P`` along ``C``, then we will say that ``L`` is tangent to ``C`` at ``P``.
